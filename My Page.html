            <p class="description">
              The Web is a complex system that connect different computers
              to share a multitude of content - documents, videos, audio, etc -
              This computers could be divide into<span class="italic"> client computers and server
              computers</span>, that interchange files through a communication protocol,<em> HTTP</em>.

            <p>
              HTML stands for <span class="italic">Hypertext Markup Language.</span>HTML has a set of instructions
              that tell the browser how to render the text in the document.

            <p>
              HTML documents are made of HTML <span class="bold">elements</span>. When writing a HTML,
              we tell the browsers the type of each element by using HTML <span class="bold">tags</span>.

              <p>
                Computers are stupid because the follow the instructions that are given
                to them without questions. This is a double-edge sword, on the one hand
                they perform precisely what was indicated, but on the other hand
                if the instructions are not correct they carry them out without noticing
                the errors.

              <p>
                HTML elements are either <span class="bold">inline</span> or <span class="bold">block</span> elements.
                Block elements have an invisible box around them, this means they always start in 
                a new line and take up the whole width of the available; while, inline elements
                don't start in a new line and only take as much width as needed.

          <h3 class="concept-title">Developer Tools (in the Browser)</h3>
          <p>
            Today, all of the major browsers have a series of features that help the developers 
            better understand how they are rendering the HTML and all the other documents associated
            with it.

          <h3 class="concept-title">The "tree-like structure" of HTML</h3>
          <p>
            The "tree-like structure" comes from the fact that HTML elements can have other elements inside of them.
            You can draw this relationship like a family tree. My mother had multiple children. So did her mother,
            and so on...
          </p>
          <p>
            In a browser, this structure shows up as a series of nested boxes. There are boxes inside of boxes 
            inside of boxes, and so on...

          <h3 class="concept-title">The relationship between indented HTML and boxes</h3>
          <p>
            When you read an HTML document as <em>text</em>, you see a wave of changing indentations going up and down the 
            left side of the document. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested it's corresponding
            "box" is.

          <h3 class="concept-title">Text Editors (for programming)</h3>
          <p>
            When writing code, programmers use special text editors (like Sublime Text for example). 
            These editors make the programmer's life easier. For example, some text editors will automatically 
            generate a closing HTML tag when you write an opening tag.
